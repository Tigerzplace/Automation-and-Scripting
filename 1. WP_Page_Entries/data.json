        "description": "Camphill Foundation UK & Ireland, established in 1984, is a charity supporting Camphill communities, which have been working for more than seventy years to enable those with learning disabilities, developmental disorders, mental health problems and other special needs to fulfil their potential. There are over 60 Camphill Communities in the UK and Ireland, including schools, colleges and training centres for children and young people, working communities for adults in need of special care, and a centre for the elderly. Assistance is given to capital projects such as the building of new accommodation, developing new workshops and facilities, agricultural and horticultural activities, provision of new equipment and educational, training, cultural and social initiatives. Support is sometimes in the form of \ufffdseed\ufffd funding of grants up to \ufffd20,000 to help projects get started. Donations support much more than a single project because the Foundation more frequently provides loans, at a low rate of interest, and when the money is repaid it becomes available to help with another project, then another, and so on. PLEASE HELP US TO HELP OTHERS.",
